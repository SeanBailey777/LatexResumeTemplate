        \item Enhanced efficiency and customer satisfaction for 25+ franchises
              and 5000+ locations with an automated voice-based service for
              20,000+
              restaurant orders per day. Used Scala, Clojure, Quill (for SQL),
              and Circe (for
              JSON). Deployed on GCP, integrated voice recognition, synthesis,
              and NLP
              services from Microsoft Azure.
        \item Reduced voice recognition costs by 40\%, potentially saving
              \$144,000 annually, by developing a new RESTful audio stream
              client for Speech
              Recognition Service on Microsoft Azure, using Scala.
        \item Generated a 40\% increase in new business opportunities by
              implementing a RESTful ToIP Text Service channel for SMS
              communication using
              Scala, Twitter Finagle, SQL, and Circe.
        \item Achieved a 100\% recovery rate of unanswered HTTP calls by
              developing a Retryable Filter for RESTful calls within the SMS
              client, using
              Scala and Twitter Finagle.
        \item Prevented 75\% of user call drops by implementing an order
              resuming capability feature, using Scala, SQL, and JSON.
        \item Reduced response time by 50\% with load
              balancers for voice synthesis, using Scala and Twitter Finagle.
        \item Created a hash string generator to efficiently map orders and
              services, and enabling shortened URLs, using Scala and
              SQL.
        \item Reduced NLP failures by 30\%, improved various voice command
              handling and enhanced exception handling using Scala, leveraging
              insights from
              error logs in Datadog and Grafana.
        \item Improved data retrieval accuracy by 30\% for address parsing,
              using Scala and Regular
              Expressions.
        \item Improved UI sections and created keyboard shortcuts with Clojure
              for testing webpage UI, using Clojure and HTML.
        \item Managed Kubernetes cronjobs and reduced manual deployments using
              YAML and JSON.

        \item Reduced assessment time by 75\% and eliminated human assessment
              through an Online Judging system deployed on Microsoft Azure,
              using Python and
              Linux Shell.
        \item Saved 56 hours per week and reduced operational costs by 33\% by
              automating Docker container processes using Linux Shell scripts.
